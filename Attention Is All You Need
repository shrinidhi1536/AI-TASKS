Attention Is All You Need is a landmark research paper published in 2017 by Vaswani et al.
The paper introduces the Transformer architecture for sequence modeling tasks.
It eliminates the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The main idea is that attention mechanisms alone are sufficient to model sequences.
The model uses self-attention to capture relationships between all words in a sentence.
Self-attention helps in learning long-range dependencies efficiently.
The Transformer follows an encoder–decoder architecture.
The encoder converts the input sequence into contextual representations.
The decoder generates the output sequence one token at a time.
Multi-head attention enables the model to focus on different parts of the sequence simultaneously.
Scaled dot-product attention is used for stable and efficient computation.
Positional encoding is added to incorporate word order information.
The architecture allows parallel processing of sequences.
This leads to faster training and better scalability compared to RNN-based models.
The Transformer architecture forms the foundation of modern models such as BERT, GPT, and T5.
