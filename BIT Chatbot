BITRA is an AI-based virtual assistant developed for the Bannari Amman Institute of Technology website to support visitors.
Its main purpose is to respond to frequently asked questions related to admissions, academic programs, fee structure, hostel facilities, and contact information.
The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret user questions written in simple English.
It functions primarily as a retrieval-based chatbot, where responses are selected from a predefined knowledge base rather than being generated dynamically.
The system identifies user intent, such as admission-related queries, course details, or departmental information.
A structured database stores essential college data, including available programs, departments, infrastructure, and services.
BITRA follows a systematic process: user input → language processing → intent recognition → response retrieval → reply delivery.
This approach helps users find information quickly without navigating through multiple web pages.
The chatbot operates круглock the clock, providing instant assistance and reducing the workload of administrative staff.
It is especially useful for supporting prospective students during the admission process by offering immediate guidance.
To ensure accuracy and consistency, BITRA uses rule-based response templates.
The interface is user-friendly, featuring a simple chat window integrated into the BIT website.
Unlike advanced generative AI systems such as ChatGPT, BITRA does not generate new responses but matches queries with predefined answers.
As a result, it may struggle with complex or uncommon questions.
Overall, BITRA enhances communication and user experience by delivering fast, dependable, and automated support on the institute’s website.
